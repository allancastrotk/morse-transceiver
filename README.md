# morse-transceiver
morse-transceiver — ESP8266 CW transceiver firmware: non-blocking Arduino/PlatformIO code that captures local Morse input (button + buzzer), exchanges timed signals via Wi‑Fi/TCP with a peer, shows status on OLED and blinks Morse on LED. Designed for reproducible builds and stable releases.
